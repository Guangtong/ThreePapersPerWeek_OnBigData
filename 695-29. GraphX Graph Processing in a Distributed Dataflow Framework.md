## 29. GraphX: Graph Processing in a Distributed Dataflow Framework

#### Summary

The paper's opinion is specialized graph processing systems has optimized performance but increases system complexity and leads to unnecessary date movement when combined with other related data processing steps. With the help of the in-memory computation framework Spark, GraphX, a library proposed by the paper, can achieve the same performance as specialized system but run on general purpose framework, Spark. The main strategy used to optimize the performance on Spark by distributed join optimizations and materialized view maintenance.



#### Q1: Graph problems have gained increasing amount of interest in recent years, because many "big data" problems can be best expressed by graphs. Can you give one or two examples of graph problems that are not included in the paper and what are the vertex and edge properties of your graph(s)? What would be an interesting computation on your graph(s)?

The paper benchmarks different systems by running PageRank.

Single source shortest path problem is another typical example of graph computing.
Description: given a source vertex StartV, find the shortest path to any other vertex
vertex i is any one node in the graph (such as a position in a map)
edge (i->j) is the distance between vertex i and j

What is interesting computation? Ah, the graph may be DAG, may have negative weights. There are famous algorithms such as Dijkstra and Floyd.


#### Q2: For most graph problems, do you think they are computation-bound, memory-bound, or network I/O bound? As graphs converge over iterations, do you think the performance bottleneck will shift (and from which part to which part)? 

At first, large amount of data will be updated, network IO is the bottleneck.
As the graph converges, computation-bound becomes bottleneck as the network IO decreases.

#### Q3: Some graph applications involve dynamic graph structure change (e.g., at one time we have A->B->C, later the graph will change to B->A B->C). Do you think GraphX can support graph structure change well? Why?

GraphX uses vertex-cut partitioning. If edges change, data needs repartitioning. The network I/O is not acceptable.
If the graph will change, I think edge-cut partitioning systems will be better.
