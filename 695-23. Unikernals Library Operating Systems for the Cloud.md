### 23. Unikernels: Library Operating Systems for the Cloud (ASPLOS'13)

#### Summary
The paper brings the idea of Library OS to virtualization in data center systems. The libOS integrates configuration  into the compilation process so applications are sealed with the OS into a specialized system, which cost less resources to run and less effort to configure.


#### Q1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of unikernels compared to full-guest-OS virtualization? What about comparing to running applications on native OS (i.e., no virtualization)?

Advantage:  
1. The main advantage is specialized system cost less resources (less image-size, less memory and CPU load) due to no redundant services.  
2. The secondary advantage is the configuration is compiled into the image. The configuration is programmable in a host language hence benefiting from static analysis tools and the compiler's type-checker.  

Disadvantage:
1. Difficult to make any change when part of the services are changed or upgraded, only to recompile and reinstall.  


Running on native OS will lose the flexibility of scaling of a machine.

#### Q2: Can unikernels scale well (e.g., running 1000 unikernels on one hypervisor/physical machine at the same time)?

The paper considers scaling. Unikernels can scale horizontally without difficulty but hard to scale vertically.

#### Q3: Are unikernels better for security (easier to provide security) than full-guest-OS virtualization? Why or why not?

Yes. Since only selected services are compiled in the system, it is less prone to attacks on system loopholes of a full-guest-OS.
