##  9/26: 12. Finding a needle in Haystack: Facebook’s photo storage, OSDI'10   

### Summary 

The paper introduces Haystack which is an object storage system specifically design to store photos. New photos are appended to logic volume (several replicated physical volumes) and pushed to cache. All meta data are stored in memory so the disk access on directory and meta data are eliminated.

### Q1: Before Haystack, Facebook used NFS on a set of NAS (network-attached storage) appliances. They mentioned several disadvantages of this approach. Can you think of one or two advantages of NFS-based approach and/or why Facebook originally decided to use NFS?

One major advantage that NFS provides is central management. Using a centrally managed server decreases the workload for the administrator in terms of back-ups, adding software that will be shared and computer repair. 

### Q2: Facebook makes extensive use of caching (actually beyond Haystack as well). Why do you think Facebook can rely heavily on caching? What's their workloads (usage) like? Also, Section 3.3 mentions they want to prioritize new writes (recently uploaded photos) in their cache. Why so?

Since haystack was designed for sharing photos on Facebook where data is written once, read often, never modiﬁed, and rarely deleted. 

Photos have the property that they are most heavily accessed soon after they are uploaded. So cache recent photos actively will avoid many disk access.


### Q3: Haystack writes everything in an append-only fashion and does not have any special allocation policies (i.e., just write the new photo in the next available space). Will this result in many random reads later on? Why so or why not?

There will be random reads. For frequent reads, they use CDN and local cache. For reads on long tail objects, the meta data is in memory so random access cost only one disk access.
