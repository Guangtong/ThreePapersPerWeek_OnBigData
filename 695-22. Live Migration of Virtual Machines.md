### 22. Live Migration of Virtual Machines (NSDI'05) 

#### Summary
Virtual machines provide a benefit that the whole system can be migrated, which facilitates fault management and load balancing of data center servers.
Live migration is useful because the very low down-time. The main technique used by the paper is "pre-copy" plus short pause. 


#### Q1: What are the advantage and disadvantage of migrating a whole VM over migrating user processes?
Advantage:  
1. Avoid the problem of "residual dependencies" due to the narrow interface between guest OS and VMM.
2. In-memory state and configurations are kept so the whole server can be migrated in live.
3. Operator doesn't need to access the OS when migrating.

Disadvantage:
1. The migration is heavy in terms of network bandwidth and CPU load.


#### Q2: If there is no forcing into the stop-and-copy stage (i.e., only performing iterative pre-copy), can the migration process ever terminate (i.e., no more things to copy)? Why?
If the original machine does not pause, the OS and processes will keep changing because of context switch in processes rescheduling.
The copy will never stop.

#### Q3: The Xen Live Migration paper does not handle virtual disk migration. Why is it OK to not worry about migrating disks? and what makes it harder (costlier) to migrate storage?

Network-attached storage (NAS) prevails in the modern data center. Storage are distributed and shared so disk migration is not needed.
Storage migration is difficult because it takes very long to be transfered blaming its large size.
