## 18. Disco: Running Commodity Operating Systems on Scalable Multiprocessors (TOCS'97)

#### Summary

Disco is a virtual machine monitor to run several VMs on a shared-memory multiprocessor architecture. The VMs can share memory and disk resources so Disco provided a solution to using commodity operating systems on scalable multiprocessors.


#### Q1: What's the original motivation of Disco (i.e., why did Mendal Rosenblum and the Stanford team revive the 70s virtual machine idea)? What's the main reason behind the successful adoption of virtualization in datacenters in the past ~15 years?

As scalable multiprocessor computers came to the market but no commodity operating systems support the hardware easily. So they came up with the idea of  put a virtual machine layer between operating systems and the hardware.

Virtualization offers several benefits to improve the efficiency of data center management. 

1. Heterogenous hardware resources are managed in a pool and virtualized as same homogenous resources.

2. VMs can be managed together, easily creating, deleting, replicating.

3. Failure recovery and hardware upgrade becomes transparent to VMs.

#### Q2: What happens when there is a TLB miss in the guest OS (assuming software-managed TLB)? Walk through the steps after that TLB miss until the memory instruction completes in the guest OS.

TLB miss handler first consults the second-level TLB, which is a cache belongs to the guest OS itself.
If it finds a matching virtual address it use this entry to get machine address and put it to the hardware TLB.
Otherwise, it forwards a TLB miss exception to the guest OS so that the guest OS will look up for the virtual address in its page table. The entry found is virtual-address to physical-address, which will be translated to virtual-address to machine-address and stored in hardware TLB.

#### Q3: Do you find this paper more difficult to understand than our previous papers? If so, is the book chapter above useful? (This is a survey question, please answer truthfully. I'll treat it as anonymous.)

No. OS course has talked about virtualization. I think previous papers are harder.
