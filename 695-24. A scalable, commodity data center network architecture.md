# 24. A scalable, commodity data center network architecture

#### Summary

The paper proposed a network architecture for the inner communication inside a data center which used only commodity level switches and routers can can scale easily. The architecture is based on fat-tree topology. 

#### Q1: FatTree has many benefits and thus is widely deployed in many datacenters. What do you think is the main reason of its success? Can you think of a disadvantage/limitation of FatTree?

The main reason is that all switching elements are identical, enabling us to leverage cheap commodity parts for all of the switches int the communication architecture.

Limitation: Flows on a fat tree topology have quite a long path, traveling from edge switches, up the network to the core and back down again when fully crossing the tree. Therefore the average speed is limited.

#### Q2: FatTree assumes that all switches are the same (same number of ports and same per-port bandwidth). What if we change the cores switches to have their per-port bandwidth doubled and still with the same number of ports; that is, in Figure 3, each port of a core switch has 20Gbps and the core switch still has four ports, and all other switches still have four 10Gbps ports. In that case how many core switches do we need to achieve the same bisection bandwidth (same performance) as the current Figure 3? What about changing core switches to have eight 10Gbps ports; how many core switches do we need?

I think in either modification, only two core switches are needed to achieve the same total bandwidth of the cores switches as the original one. 10Gbps * 4 * 4 = 160 Gbps.

#### Q3: FatTree's two-level routing is largely static (i.e., path is decided mostly on destination host IP) and FatTree does not do any congestion control. Do you think this can work well in reality in datacenters?

If jobs are scheduled randomly or evenly on distributed machines, congestion is not a big problems.
When congestion is a problem, there are further modifications on FatTree to enable congestion control.
For example the way in the paper "Congestion Control Using OpenFlow in Software Defined Data Center Networks".
