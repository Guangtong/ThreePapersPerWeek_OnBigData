## 10. The Google File System

### Summary

The paper described the principle of Google File System which is a distributed file system suitable for storing large files. The high reliability of data is guaranteed by replicas of chunks. The meta data of chunks are stored in one master node. The client talks to the master node to chunk allocation information and then read/write directly from/to the data nodes.

### Q1: What applications was GFS designed for? Can you think of one or two specific examples (instead of saying "Google application")?

GFS is designed to store large files in a distributed system. It is the base of google's map-reduce and big-table. Its open source version - hdfs - has been widely used in web crawler, nosql, cloud storage, parallel computing.


### Q2: GFS uses just one master node. Do you think this is a good idea? Why and why not?

This is good because one master node is enough to store the meta data of chunks. Since file stream directly goes to data node, the master node has not much traffic.
The master node also has a replica to achieve high availability. 

### Q3: Why does GFS map full path names to metadata instead of the traditional file system's way of maintaining "directory"

Because data node store chunks of files only. There is no directory in fact. The full paths are only the identification of the files.
