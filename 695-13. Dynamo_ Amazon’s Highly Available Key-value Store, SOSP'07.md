# 13. Dynamo: Amazonâ€™s Highly Available Key-value Store, SOSP'07  

### Summary
Dynamo DB is a Key Value NoSQL Database used by Amazon and its cloud services. The design target is a "always on" system, which means high reliability and high availability. It uses consistent-hashing algorihm for sharding and has replicas for each data object. But it sacrifices consistency under some failure scenarios to achieve high level of availability.


### Q1: What is eventual consistency and why does Amazon choose this consistency level?
The replicated versions of a data object can have inconsistency branches but will finally resolved.

Amazon wants to provide higher availability than transaction operation with not so much computing resources. Further more the system should always accept writing and reading request to have good customer experience. So they decided to sacrifice some consistency.



### Q2: How and when does Dynamo resolves conflicts?
It doesn't solve conflicts on write. Instead, each writing appends the current context to the object. The context is the writing handling server and data version on this server.
Conflicts may happen when two versions have no causal ordering but parallel. All versions are return to the clients, and conflicts are solved by clients and then written back to the servers.


### Q3: What is "sloppy quorem"?
If using strict quorem, the coordinator will send writing or reading requests to top N nodes in  the preference list and wait for a majority number of successful responses before respond success to the client.
But with the help of other nodes beyond the top N nodes in the preference list, failed writing can be handed to other nodes. After the failed nodes recover, the data will be returned. So the amount of successful responses doesn't need to be the majority but can be a small number.
