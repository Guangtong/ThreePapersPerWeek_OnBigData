## 03. The Chubby Lock Service for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems, Mike Burrows, Google (OSDI'06) 

### Summary

The paper introduces Chubby which is designed to provide advisory lock service for shared resources. Chubby itself is composed of several replicas and among them a master is chosen using Paxos. All operations are done on the master and copied to replicas using Paxos too. 
Chubby is in essence a file system which can store small amount of data. The lock service is build upon the file system since each file and directory can act as a reader/writer lock.

### Q1: What is a lock service? Why does a lock service like Chubby involve consensus agreement?

Like on a single computer, files may be accessed at the same time so locks are needed to protect the files from conflicting writing. On a distributed system, a file is stored distributively with replicas, so a lock service is needed to control the access of the files.

Chubby has several replicas so they need consensus on the operations to the files inside them.

### Q2: How does Chubby deal with master failure and make the fail-over smooth (i.e., little interference with clients)?

Lease timer stops. 
New master is voted and restart the lease timer. 
The client waits in the grace period when the lease timer stops until a new mater is found.

 
### Q3: This paper is not a typical research paper and is a more on the experience, engineering side. You will find many practical concerns that guided the design and implementation of Chubby. Do you find such papers interesting? What lessons learned by Google do you find most interesting or surprising?

More interesting than pure theory.
"Developers rarely consider availability" is worth noting. I also thought a robust service like Chubby which has replicas will be always available. But this lesson from Google tells distributed services can have short outages.
