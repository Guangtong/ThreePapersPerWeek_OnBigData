## 26. A Clean Slate 4D Approach to Network Control and Management 

#### Summary

The paper proposed a 4-plane architecture (decision, dissemination, discovery, and data) to completely separate an Autonomous System's decision logic from protocols that govern the interaction among network elements solving the network  fragility caused by today's networks' complex and unwieldy control and management infrastructure. 



#### Q1: In a way, the SDN approach resembles classical distributed systems (e.g., think of GFS). What problems in distributed systems do SDN also face? What problems in dist sys that SDN does not have? And what problems only SDN has but not distributed systems? Give one to two examples for each question. 

Both face: scalability, availability
Dist Sys: consistency
SDN: security vulnerability


#### Q2: Comparing datacenter environments and wide-area environments (e.g., the Internet), which do you think is more appropriate for SDN or both are applicable? Answer in terms of whether or not these two environments have the issues the 4D paper states as the motivation for SDN and if the 4D approach fits these environments.

Data center environments are more appropriate for SDN.
SDN helps data center systems to solve the problems like dynamically changing components, scaling, being independent on vendors.


#### Q3: Software-define datacenter and software-defined storage (and other software-defined things) are hot topics in recent years (ref: the first two papers in recommended readings). Do you think "software-defined" is just a buzz word or do we really have a similar problem to solve and similar approach in other parts of datacenters. Give a reason why or why not you believe there should be a "software-defined storage" (some calls it SDS).

Software-defined components have many benefits that satisfy the needs of today's data centers such as flexibility, automated management and cost efficiency. 

HDFS is an example of Software-defined storage. It is valuable because of its reliability and scalability.
