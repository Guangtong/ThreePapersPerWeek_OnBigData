## 28. PowerGraph Distributed Graph-Parallel Computation on Natural Graphs

#### Summary

Powergraph is a new framework for distributed graph-parallel computation on natural graphs.
PowerGraph address the network and storage overhead issues of high-degree vertices by introducing the GAS decomposition which is going to allow us to distribute a single vertex program across the entire cluster, moving computation to the data and parallelizing these high-degree vertices. Using vertex partitioning which allows us to effectively distribute large power-law graphs. 

#### Q1: PowerGraph and GraphX uses two approaches to building graph engines: specialized graph engines built from scratch and a graph engine built on top of an existing framework (Spark). Discuss the advantage and disadvantage of these two approaches. Which do you think will have wider adoption/success?

Powergraph:
pros: specifically designed for (natural) graph algorithms on large data set. Lower network and storage overhead. Efficient partitioning.

cons: Need to install the framework and port the input and output to other non-graph analyzing stages.

GraphX:
pros: similar performance with most specialized graph engines with general purpose framework. No overhead in transporting to other non-graph stages.

cons: have to use the apis, making graph-algorithm difficult to program.

I think GraphX will have wider adoption as an integrated part on top of Spark.


#### Q2: What does "asynchronous execution" in graph mean? What is "serializability" in PowerGraph and how does it achieve serializability?

Asynchronous means new results of a vertex can be used by other vertex in the same iteration.

Serializability allows the system to run in sequence even asynchronous updating vertex.
Prevent adjacent vertex-programs from running simultaneously.


#### Q3: The paper spends a whole section discussing graph partition. Why is graph partition important? Why can a simple greedy algorithm work well? Can you think of a case where no partition algorithm will work (i.e., no matter how you partition, the resulting graph performance is always similar)?

Graph parallel abstractions rely on partitioning to minimize communication and balance computation and storage. This is achieved by assigning vertices to machines and then cutting across edges. And the number of edges cut is proportional the the network traffic of the system.

Greedy cut is in fact a direct de-randomization of the random edge-placement algorithm therefore greedily minimizes the expected number of machines spanned. 

A non-natural graph with evenly distributed edges among vertex.
