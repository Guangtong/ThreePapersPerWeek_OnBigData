## 28. PowerGraph Distributed Graph-Parallel Computation on Natural Graphs

#### Summary



#### Q1: PowerGraph and GraphX uses two approaches to building graph engines: specialized graph engines built from scratch and a graph engine built on top of an existing framework (Spark). Discuss the advantage and disadvantage of these two approaches. Which do you think will have wider adoption/success?

#### Q2: What does "asynchronous execution" in graph mean? What is "serializability" in PowerGraph and how does it achieve serializability?

#### Q3: The paper spends a whole section discussing graph partition. Why is graph partition important? Why can a simple greedy algorithm work well? Can you think of a case where no partition algorithm will work (i.e., no matter how you partition, the resulting graph performance is always similar)?
