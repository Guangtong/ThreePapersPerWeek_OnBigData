## 11. Windows Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency, SOSP'11 

### Summary
WAS has three layers: the Front-End take requests and routes to Partition Layer, Partition Layer analyse an abstract request (Blob, Table, Queue) to file system operation. The Stream Layer manage file data like GFS.

### Q1: Azure has many similarities as GFS. What's the difference and which system do you think is more flexible and which is more efficient?

First, only the Stream Layer is a counterpart of GFS which is only a distributed file system.
The differences between them are all writes in WAS go to the primary replica node and then the secondary replica nodes get data from primary node. In contrast, GFS client writes to all data node buffers, and primary data node monitors the writing process and replys to client.

I think WAS is more flexible and efficient since the client only talks to server and data communication among data nodes inside a cluster will be faster than between client and data nodes.

### Q2: Why does Azure separate its service into two layers: stream and partition? Can we use just one layer? What's the pros and cons?

Because AWS wants to store not only files (Blobs) but also Tables and Queues.
Tables are higher abstraction of file and needs to be managed to have abilities such as transaction consistency. This is a part of partition layer similar to Big Table above GFS.

Pros: The partition layer enables fine-grained data objects on corse grained file storage.
Cons: some overhead. 

### Q3: Both GFS and Azure chooses to make three replicas of their data. Why three?

This is a trade of between high reliability and high performance. More replicas need more network transportation and disk io. Two replicas are not enough to keep high reliablity on comodity level computers.
