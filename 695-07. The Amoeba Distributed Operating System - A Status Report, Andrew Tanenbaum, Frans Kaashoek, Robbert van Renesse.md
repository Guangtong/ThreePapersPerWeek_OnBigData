## 07. The Amoeba Distributed Operating System - A Status Report, Andrew Tanenbaum, Frans Kaashoek, Robbert van Renesse

### Summary
The paper described Amoeba's design purpose and main structure. Amoeba is a distributed os (also an architecture) with workstations sharing central CPUs and essential services  running on specialized servers.

### Q1: What are the targeted usages of Amoeba? Compare it with Sprite and name at least one design that Amoeba and Sprite choose differently for their targeted usages.

Amoeba is designed for workstations to share processors of the central servers. Amoeba manage CPUs in a centralized way and do not support memory share.
Sprite mainly wants to share memory among workstations  as well as share processors by migrating processes. Sprite is designed for workstations to use fully use their only resources for light jobs. There is still a central high end server to run heavy jobs.


### Q2: Name at least two advantages and one disadvantage of Amoeba's processor pool + specialized servers model.

Advantages:
1. Make full and balanced use of all processors. So the total amount of processors are reduced.
2. The specialized servers are easy to manage than making them distributed.
Disadvantages: 
A process may need to talk to many servers to do different function. The network overhead is considerable.

### Q3: Why does Amoeba choose to use "immutable" files? What are the advantages and what type of workloads can benefit from this design?

Advantages: Files stored contiguously on disk in a immutable size. So reading is fast.
Benefit: If the workload contains concurrent reading and writing, reading won't be blocked during writing since writing is creating another file.
