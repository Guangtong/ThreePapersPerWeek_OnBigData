## 31. A Reconfigurable Fabric for Accelerating Large-Scale Datacenter Services

#### Summary

The paper proposed a reconfigurable datacenter architecture with programmable devices - FPGA based daughter board.

#### Q1: Other than searching, what other datacenter workloads/problems that we've studied over the semester do you think may be able to benefit from reconfigurable fabrics and why?

Graph algorithms engines such as PowerGraph may benefit since the algorithms scale differently, some need more resources, some not.

#### Q2: For the problem(s) you find for Q1, can you map its (their) processing onto the FPGAs on the reconfigurable fabric (i.e., map to Figure 5)?

PowerGraph deals with graph vertex programs in three phases - gather, apply and scatter.
Gather and scatter are executed in parallel on vertexes which can be mapped to FPGAs.

#### Q3: Again, for the problem you find for Q1 and using the design you have for Q2, do you think this hypothetical fabric can outperform the corresponding software implementation? Why or why not?

The computing ability can be reconfigured according to the load of each vertex, so this hypothetical fabric may outperform static configuration.
