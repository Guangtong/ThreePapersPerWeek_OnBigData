## 01. Paxos Made Simple â€“ Leslie Lamport

### Summary
Paxos algorithm keeps the consistency of a variable on distributed machines, tolerating less than half *acceptors*' failure and any *proposers*' failure. 

In this algorithm, each *proposer* has two phases: get the current value and writing permission from over half *acceptors* with its unique sequence number; broadcasting the current value if any, otherwise boradcast its own value. 

The *proposer* stops if it lost permission from *acceptors* when some higher-number *proposers* preempt the permission. 

Whenever more than half *acceptors* have the same value, the learner learns the value so that it is chosen and never changed.


### Q1: What does Paxos try to achieve?
A mechanism to help update a variable on distributed machines with consistency and concurrency, tolerating the failure of any *proposer* or less than a half *acceptors*.  


### Q2: Why is agreement hard?
These problems need to be solved:
 * Concurrent *proposers* may override earlier values; (Solved by higher number preemptive permission)
 * Failed *acceptors* may have inconsistent data; (Solved by majority determination)
 * Failed *acceptors* or *proposers* may block all updates; (Also solved by higher number preemptive permission)


### Q3: When and how is the value `v` chosen?
When the *proposer* broadcast `v` to *acceptors* and more than half *acceptors* accept the value, `v` is chosen. 
After `v` is chosen, higher-number *proposers* directly return with the chosen value without changing it.
If `v` is not chosen, higher-number *proposers* will help broadcast `v` if they see `v` in their first phase.
