# 16. Dryad: Distributed Data-Parallel Programs from Sequential Building Blockss
### Guangtong Shen

Dryad is a parallel job scheduling framework on distributed computers. A job is organized as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with computing tasks in the vertices and data flows in the edges. The framework is general-purpose since the DAG can be any form.

### Q1: Compare to MapReduce, Dryad supports more flexibility by allowing arbitrary functions at the vertices and three types of data communication at the edges. Can you think of an example (other than the ones in the paper) that can be easily expressed by Dryad but not by MapReduce?

MapReduce is in fact a specail DAG job, as depicted in Figure 3.d, noted as AS>>BS.

Other more complex work patterns (Figure 3.e to 3.h) cannot be transformed to one map-reduce task easily.


### Q2: Dryad requires its graph to be acyclic. What happens if there's a cycle in the graph?

Data flow in the circle. If data type can be accepted, the flow will continue endlessly. Otherwise, the task is stucked by error input.


### Q3: Dryad allows dynamic graph refinement and performance optimization. Do you think this is a good idea? Why and why not? Does MapReduce support dynamic performance optimization?

Good idea because refinement saves network bandwidth by aggregation near data source and sending results in much smaller sizes to final destination.

MapReduce can have similar optimization - do some reduce work on the map-side, but needs configuration by the application developer.
