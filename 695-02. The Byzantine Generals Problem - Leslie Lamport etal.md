## 02. The Byzantine Generals Problem - Leslie Lamport etal

### Summary

The paper propose two algorithms to solve Byzantine Generals Problems with Oral Messages and Signed Messages, respectively.

The OM(m) algorithm recursively calls itself OM(m-1) to exchange messages. It can solve OM problem with m traitors and at least 3m+1 Generals.

The SM(m) algorithm add a signature path with the message on sending the message. It can solve SM problem with m traitors.

### Q1: What are Byzantine faults (faults that can happen in the Byzantine problem) and how are they different from faults in Paxos?

To reach agreement on a message, each node receives and sends the message among them. But some nodes may fail and change the true message sometimes. 

Paxos solve non-Byzantine problem, which assumes the message may be lost but can't be changed.

### Q2: What is the complexity of the solution with oral messages (in big O)?

O(n^(m-1)) 


### Q3: In datacenter systems, which do you think is more widely deployed, Paxos or Byzantine, and why?

Paxos is more common which solves non-byzantine distributed message consensus.
Byzantine failure is the most severe problem which seldom happens. I think a distributed system can control the failed nodes to just stop and restart without sending wrong messages.
