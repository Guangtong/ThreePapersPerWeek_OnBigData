## 33 Hints for Computer System Design

#### Summary

The paper summarized some hints for building a successful computer system. These hints are categorized into completeness/interface/implementation which is the hints plays a role. The hints are useful in three aspects functionality/speed/fault-tolerance.

The main hints are:
Keep the functionality simple, do one thing at a time.
Keep basic interfaces stable.
Ready to throw away previous work and have a prototype.
Divide and conquer to solve problems.
Handle normal and worst cases separately.
Split resources in a fixed way rather than sharing them.
Compute in background.
Use batch processing if possible. 
End-to-end check for fault-tolerance
Use log.
Make actions atomic or restartable.


#### Course

Datacenter Systems is a complex topic which covers distributed system, networking, work flow pattern, virtualization, data processing and machine learning frameworks. We should consider the system scalability, service availability, data consistency and reliability, as well as the cost of devices and management. 
To really master the skill of datacenter systems, we need to work deeply into one system, which may take a very long time in our later career.
