# 14. Fast Crash Recovery in RAMCloud, John Ousterhout etal. SOSP'11

### Summary

RAMCloud is a DRAM-based storage system with data stored in the main memory of distributed master nodes. Replicated data are stored in disks of backup nodes. There is a coordinator keeping the mapping from data object key to master location, which is also cached in the clients. The paper introduced the procedure to recover memory data from disks on backups and claims the recovery is very fast.

### Q1: What's the rationale behind RAMCloud that justify storing all data in DRAM? What's the reason that RAMCloud only stores one copy of data in DRAM and no replica? 

RAM access is much faster than disk IO. When RAM cost gets lower and lower, the performance-price ratio is acceptable to have high availability.

Still ram replica is costly. RAM Cloud is designed to be able to recover from disk very fast so RAM replica in not included.

### Q2: RAMCloud is a nice idea and a great research project. But it has very limited adoption in industry. Can you think of any reasons why industry doesn't want to adopt this idea? 
1. The coordinator is a centralized server which needs high availablity. The crash of coordinator will cause the whole system down.
2. Even the recovery from disk is fast there is still a period when the data is not available. 
3. Only one copy of data in ram doesn't benefit concurrency reading like other multi-replica storage systems.
4. The algorithm for fast recovery is too complex 

### 3: RAMCloud improves recovery bandwidth by using a lot of parallelism and randomizations. In doing so, it avoids many bottlenecks (e.g., network, single machine, disk bandwidth). Do these bottlenecks exist in the previous distributed storage systems we talked about (GFS, Haystack, Azure, Dynamo)? Did they solve these bottlenecks? Is recovery bandwidth as important for these systems?
 RAMcloud relies on fast recovery to have high availability since it has no replica in memory.
 The other four are not ram-based storage. When one server is down, other replicas of the data in this server can still be requested. The recover
