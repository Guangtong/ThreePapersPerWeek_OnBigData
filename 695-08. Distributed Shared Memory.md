## 08. Distributed Shared Memory

### Summary
Distributed shared memory system logically implements the shared-memory model on a physically distributed-memory  system, so it combines the advantages of the two approaches. The two paper discussed the three key issues when accessing data items in the DSM address space, while maintaining the data consistent.

### Q1: What type of usage do DSM systems want to support (how users can use DSM)? Do you think this usage model is useful in today's datacenters?

The goal is to use distributed workstations on parallel computing and achieve similar performance as high end machines. Today's distributed system like Hadoop has the same goal but different model.

### Q2: DSM has a lot of similarity to a shared memory multi-processor single machine. What's the difference and what are the unique challenges of DSM (that were not solved by multi-processor machine)?

DSM provides a global memory address space which made it similar to shared-memory system but physically it has distributed memory on each machine.
The challenge is to provide a transparent interface to programmers and maintain data consistency.

### Q3: DSM only let users access memory data (and cache them locally) but does not replicate data. Why? In general, do you think it's a good idea to replicate memory content (note: here replicate is not caching)? 

Memory data is not persistent so replica is not quite useful. Memory replica wastes memory and has problems of consistency. So it may not be good to replicate memory content.
