## 04. ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems, Yahoo (ATC'10)

### Summary
The paper introduces ZooKeeper, another coordinator service system. The system has one master and several slaves who are replicas of the master. Data update is done on the master and broadcast to slaves using ZAB protocal (like Paxos). Data reading can be responded by any server so the reading performance is better than Chubby.
Zookeeper has no primitive lock to provide wait free access of its files.


### Q1: What's the goal of ZooKeeper? Why does ZooKeeper wants to supporting asynchronous (or wait-free) requests?

ZooKeeper wants to have better performance than chubby by moving away the lock primitive. Wait-free requests prevent slow clients to have negative impact on the performance of fast clients.

### Q2: Why is ordering of wait-free requests important in ZooKeeper?

Since ZooKeeper has no lock, it needs to record the the request order to know which client has the access to a file first. FIFO client ordering and linearizable writes are enough to provide the coordinator service.

### Q3: Why do both Chubby and ZooKeeper use replicated databases with snapshots and write-ahead logs? Is it enough to just store everything in memory?

Snapshots and write-ahead logs together can guarantee a failed replica can restore to the same state as the master when restarts. Only store things in memory is not enough since snapshots may not be up to date with new changes.
