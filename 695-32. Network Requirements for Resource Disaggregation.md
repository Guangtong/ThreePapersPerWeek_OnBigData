## 32. Network Requirements for Resource Disaggregation

#### Summary


The paper proposed a workload-driven approach to derive the minimum latency and bandwidth requirements that the network in disaggregated datacenters must provide to avoid degrading application-level performance and explore the feasibility of meeting these requirements with existing system designs and commodity networking technology.

#### Q1: What's your view towards resource disaggregation in datacenters? Do you think disaggregated resource architecture will replace the current server-centric architecture in datacenters? why or why not?

Resource disaggregation is quite useful for many cloud services. For one example, the Purdue Computing Clusters enable a user own some storage and then apply for CPUs whenever he needs to run a job. For another example, the EC2 of AWS enables a user to rent a virtual machine with any CPU/Memory/Storage composition.

DDC has the trend to replace server-centric data centers as DDC is more flexible and convenient to maintain.

#### Q2: The paper made quite a few hardware and networking assumptions. Which assumption(s) do you think are problematic (e.g., over-simplifies system, may not work in real, etc.)?

The assumptions seem to be very reasonable.
The hardware organization assumption may be a bit problematic (We assume a “mixed” organization in which each rack hosts a mix of different types of resource blades) since hardware resources may not be uniformly distributed on physical machines. Some machines may be assigned with much more storage, some with much better CPU performance. 


#### Q3: Other than using the remote memory as swap device as in the paper, how else do you think the remote memory can be used? (hint: we've discuss about at least one such usage before in the class)

Remote memory can become a memory pool shared by all machines.
