##  09. Latency-Tolerant Software Distributed Shared Memory, ATC'15

### Summary
This paper introduced Grappa, a distributed shared memory system which is used to provide an abstraction of distributed machines as a single machine to improve the performance of parallel computing in memory.


### Q1: DSM is an idea in 80s and 90s. Many DSM systems were built at that time but none of them took over and had the success like distributed storage systems or other modern distributed systems in datacenters. The Grappa paper revives this old idea of DSM. Why (or why not) do you think DSM is useful in today's datacenters? What has changed from the old time?
Useful:
DSM facilities in-memory computing thus improve performance applications such as MapReduce and SQL query.

Change:
According to the paper, old DSM performed poorly largely duo to limited inter-node bandwidth, high inter-node latency, and global virtual memory backing. Now there are high-bandwidth low latency networks with remote memory access capability.

### Q2: Grappa's main idea is to ship processing close to where memory data is instead of bringing memory close to where processor is. What's the benefit and limitations of this?
benefit:
Automated load balancing
limitation:
Overhead of copying process environment.


### Q3: What's the difference between Grappa's delegate functions and traditional RPC?
They both execute codes on another node but delegation limit the execution only on one core and the local memory.
