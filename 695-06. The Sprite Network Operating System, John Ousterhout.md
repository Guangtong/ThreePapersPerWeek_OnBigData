## 06. The Sprite Network Operating System, John Ousterhout 

### Summary

A network operating system running on distributed workstations in LAN to help the workstations 1. share files among workstations, 2 share memory among processes inside one workstation, 3 migrate processes among workstations. 

### Q1: What are the targeted use of Sprite (i.e., what type of users and usage is Sprite designed for)? Do you think that's a typical use in today's datacenters?

When workstations in LAN had somewhat high performance themselves so that they could perform computing jobs in the distributed environment  without access to the larger central server. Sprite is designed to manage these work stations.

No. Today's data center has specified servers to store data (distributed file system or Database) and specified servers to provide computing service.

### Q2: One of the major design goals of Sprite is to provide transparency to users. What does transparency mean? Name at least one advantage and one disadvantage of transparency.

Users manipulate files in the same ways they did under on a single machine. The distributed nature of the file system is invisible to the users.
Advantage: Manage the whole file system in a single machine. Full and easy use of all disk storage.
Disadvantage: Can not distinguish local place which is fast than remote places when fast writing is needed. 

### Q3: Sprite only provides kernel-level RPC but not user-level RPC. Why do you think the authors made that decision (not providing user-level RPC)?

To improve performance. Only kernel-level RPC ensures safety without encryption and validation.
