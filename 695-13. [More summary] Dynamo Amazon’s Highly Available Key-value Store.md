Summery:

Dynamo DB is a Key Value NoSQL Database used by Amazon and its cloud services. The design target is a "always on" system, which means high reliability and high availability. It uses consistent-hashing algorihm for sharding and has replicas for each data object. But it sacrifices consistency under some failure scenarios to achieve high level of availability. 

The paper basically has three parts. Sections 1,2,3 are all about backgrounds. Sections 4 is the description of the architecture. Section 5 and 6 are practice.

Let's talk about the background first.

Amazon's business requires it to have high reliabitliy and high availablity even in peak loads.
Similar to goole file system, the servers are mainly commodity level severs so the software system need to be constructed in a manner that treats failure handiling as the nomal case without impacting availabity or performance.

The design is based on Four main assumption which correspond to Amazon's use case.

The Query Model Assumption: 
Most data are not structured relational data. Most queries are just query on the primary key. So Relational database waste hardware and computing time to provide these service. So dynamo db is designed to be key-value database. As far as I know, it has a primary key for hashing a data object to server nodes. A range query key for sorting and range query. And value area which is seariablized binary data of any type.

ACID Properties assumption:
ACID is the property of transactions which has strong consistency.
But amazon wants to provide higher availabity than transcation operation with not so much computing resources. Further more the system should always accept writing and reading request to have good customer experience. So they decided to sacrifice some consistency.


Efficiency assumption:
The latency requirement is stringent which is modeled using SLA. which is [1]. This is because: [2][3][4]

The fourth assumption is internal seurity. 

Next the paper talks about design considerations. Mostly the replica consistency consideration. [5]-[9]
Dynamo chooses to provide conflicting data to the clients when reading and the clients do the conflict resolution and then write back to the data base.

The other four design prinples are related to partitioning. Let's just jumpt over section 3 and into the partitioning algortithm and then look back at the four design principles.
