## 25. Helios A Hybrid Electrical Optical Switch Architecture for Modular Data Centers

#### Summary
The paper proposed to use the combination of Electrical Packet Switches and Optical Circuit Switches in the interconnection among pods (a pod is a modular comprised of hundreds to thousands of servers connected by non-blocking switches) to reduce the cost of full provisioned packet-switched network. 

#### Q1 Even though photonics and optical switches have gained more attention in recent years, they still haven't made their way into datacenters. Other than the limitations discussed in the paper, can you think of any other reason why datacenters are reluctant to adopt optical switches

The key limitation of Optical Circuit Switches is the latency in switching, which is discussed in the paper. There may be other limitations such as less flexibility and hard to control flow only in the optical domain.

#### Q2 How well do you think Helios can scale? What about comparing to FatTree?

The electrical packet switches which are used in low latency transfer can still scale using strategies such as FatTree.
The optical switches which are used in high capacity transfer can scale by adding more switches in parallel, which is easier than FatTree.

#### Q3 Looking at Figure 3 and Figure 4, can you think of a case that makes Helios decide to change from Fig 3's topology to Fig4's topology

When both high capacity and low latency are needed, but less flows need to be switched.
